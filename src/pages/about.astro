      <p class="mb-8">
        The Washboard is a locally owned and operated laundromat located at {contactInfo.address.formatted}. We opened our doors with a simple goal: to give the Murray community a clean, comfortable, and dependable place to do laundry. From day one, that mission has guided everything we do — from the equipment we choose to the way we care for our space.
      </p>
